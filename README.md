Hi, I am a first year B.Tech student from CSE Department. I am particularly interested in the field of Deep Learning and Computational Neuroscience, altough looking to explore more topics of interest in college. 

I want to contribute to open source because it provides a way to give to the community in some sense, by letting me work on real world problems. It will allow me to create a meaningful impact on some tool that will be used by a large group of people. It's a great oppurtuninty to enhance my coding skills as well as help to facilitate networking!
